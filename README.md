# OOP_Ass01

The purpose of the program is to create a Java Console Application that demonstrates a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, particularly focusing on inheritance and polymorphism. 
By designing and implementing a hierarchy of classes, the program showcases how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes. This leads to the creation of a well-structured application that 
incorporates input and output through the console, utilizes primitive data types, employs the ArrayList data structure, and effectively employs selection and looping statements.

The program also highlights the concept of method overriding, where subclasses provide their own implementation of methods inherited from superclasses. By accomplishing these objectives, the program aims to 
establish a foundation of OOP expertise while offering a practical illustration of these principles in action.

Furthermore, the accompanying report serves to document the development process, challenges faced, and solutions applied. Screenshots of the application's output, including error reports, offer insights into 
the testing and debugging phases. The program's optional upload to GitHub showcases a commitment to sharing knowledge and providing a tangible example of the developed application.

In summary, the program's purpose is to serve as a learning tool and showcase the application of OOP principles through a Java Console Application, enhancing understanding of inheritance, polymorphism, and related programming concepts.
